# Stock Analysis
Module 2 Coursework

## Overview
The initial code for this practice exercise may have proven capable of handling a small number of stocks, however the code could be refactored to also be effective when used to provide information on significantly larger sets of stocks. While I experienced some challenges in attempting to execute the updated code, the intended purpose for this challenge was clear - refine VBA code to more efficienctly utilize computing resources in preparation for handling larger amounts of data. I recently reviewed the VBA code and fixed prior errors to produce working code. 

## Results
Use of variables and working code will permit this VBA script to work efficiently over larger data sets. 

## Summary
Updated code actually works.
